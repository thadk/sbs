## 1

The way you can go isn't the real way.
The name you can say isn't the real name.
Heaven and earth begin in the unnamed:
name's the mother of the ten thousand things.
So the unwanting soul sees what's hidden, and the ever-wanting soul sees only what it wants.
Two things, one origin, but different in name, whose identity is mystery.
Mystery of all mysteries!
The door to the hidden.

## 2

Everybody on earth knowing that beauty is beautiful makes ugliness.
Everybody knowing that goodness is good makes wickedness.
For being and nonbeing arise together;
hard and easy complete each other;
long and short shape each other;
high and low depend on each other;
note and voice make the music together;
before and after follow each other.

That's why the wise soul does without doing, teaches without talking.
The things of this world exist, they are; you can't refuse them.
To bear and not to own; to act and not lay claim;
to do the work and let it go: for just letting it go is what makes it stay. 

## 3

Not praising the praiseworthy keeps people uncompetitive.
Not prizing rare treasures keeps people from stealing.
Not looking at the desirable keeps the mind quiet.
So the wise soul governing people would empty their minds, fill their bellies, weaken their wishes, strengthen their bones, keep people unknowing,
unwanting, keep the ones who do know from doing anything.
When you do not-doing, nothing's out of order. 

## 4

The way is empty, used, but not used up.
Deep, yes! ancestral to the ten thousand things.
Blunting edge, loosing bond, dimming light, the way is the dust of the way.
Quiet, yes, and likely to endure.
Whose child? born before the gods.  

## 5

Heaven and earth aren't humane.
To them the ten thousand things are straw dogs.
Wise souls aren't humane.
To them the hundred families are straw dogs.
Heaven and earth act as a bellows:
Empty yet structured, it moves, inexhaustibly giving. 

## 6

The valley spirit never dies.
Call it the mystery, the woman.
The mystery, the Door of the Woman, is the root of earth and heaven.
Forever this endures, forever.
And all its uses are easy. 

## 7

Heaven will last, earth will endure.
How can they last so long?
They don't exist for themselves and so can go on and on.
So wise souls leaving self behind move forward, and setting self aside stay centered.
Why let the self go?
To keep what the soul needs.

## 8

True goodness is like water.
Water's good for everything.
It doesn't compete.
It goes right to the low loathsome places,
and so finds the way.
For a house, the good thing is level ground.
In thinking, depth is good.
The good of giving is magnanimity;
of speaking, honesty; of government, order.
The good of work is skill, and of action, timing.
No competition, so no blame. 

## 9

Brim-fill the bowl, it'll spill over.
Keep sharpening the blade, you'll soon blunt it.
Nobody can protect a house full of gold and jade.
Wealth, status, pride, are their own ruin.
To do good, work well, and lie low is the way of the blessing.

## 10

Can you keep your soul in its body, hold fast to the one, and so learn to be whole?
Can you center your energy, be soft, tender, and so learn to be a baby?
Can you keep the deep water still and clear, so it reflects without blurring?
Can you love people and run things, and do so by not doing?
Opening, closing the Gate of Heaven, can you be like a bird with her nestlings?
Piercing bright through the cosmos, can you know by not knowing?
To give birth, to nourish, to bear and not to own, to act and not lay claim, to lead and not to rule: this is mysterious power.
