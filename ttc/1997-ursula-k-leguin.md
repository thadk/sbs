## 1
Taoing  
The way you can go  
isn't the real way.  
The name you can say  
isn't the real name.  

Heaven and earth  
begin in the unnamed:  
name's the mother  
of the ten thousand things.  

So the unwanting soul  
sees what's hidden,  
and the ever-wanting soul  
sees only what it wants.  


Two things, one origin,  
but different in name,  
whose identity is mystery.  
Mystery of all mysteries!  
The door to the hidden. 

## 2   
Soul food  
Everybody on earth knowing  
that beauty is beautiful  
makes ugliness.  
Everybody knowing  
that goodness is good  
makes wickedness.  
For being and nonbeing  
arise together;  
hard and easy  
complete each other;  
long and short  
shape each other;  
high and low  
depend on each other;  
note and voice  
make the music together;  
before and after  
follow each other.  

That's why the wise soul  
does without doing,  
teaches without talking.  
The things of this world  
exist, they are;  
you can't refuse them.  
To bear and not to own;  
to act and not lay claim;  
to do the work and let it go:  
for just letting it go  
is what makes it stay.  

## 3
Hushing  
Not praising the praiseworthy  
keeps people uncompetitive.  

Not prizing rare treasures  
keeps people from stealing.  

Not looking at the desirable  
keeps the mind quiet.  

So the wise soul  
governing people  
would empty their minds,  
fill their bellies,  
weaken their wishes,  
strengthen their bones,  

keep people unknowing,  
unwanting,  
keep the ones who do know  
from doing anything.  

When you do not-doing,  
nothing's out of order.   

## 4
Sourceless  
The way is empty,  
used, but not used up.  
Deep, yes! ancestral  
to the ten thousand things.

Blunting edge,  
loosing bond,  
dimming light,  
the way is the dust of the way.  

Quiet,  
yes, and likely to endure.  
Whose child? born  
before the gods.  

## 5
Useful emptiness  
Heaven and earth aren't humane.  
To them the ten thousand things  
are straw dogs.  

Wise souls aren't humane.  
To them the hundred families  
are straw dogs.  

Heaven and earth  
act as a bellows: 

Empty yet structured,  
it moves, inexhaustibly   giving.  

## 6
What is complete  
The valley spirit never dies.  
Call it the mystery, the woman.  

The mystery,  
the Door of the Woman,  
is the root  
of earth and heaven.  
Forever this endures, forever.  
And all its uses are easy.  

## 7

Dim brightness  
Heaven will last,  
earth will endure.  
How can they last so long?  
They don't exist for themselves  
and so can go on and on.

So wise souls  
leaving self behind  
move forward.  
and setting self aside  
stay centered.  
Why let the self go?  
To keep what the soul needs.  

## 8

Easy by nature  
True goodness  
is like water.  
Water's good  
for everything.  
It doesn't compete. 

It goes right  
to the low loathsome places,  
and so finds the way.

For a house,  
the good thing is level ground.  
In thinking,  
depth is good.  
The good of giving is magnanimity;  
of speaking, honesty;  
of government, order.  
The good of work is skill,  
and of action, timing. 

No competition,  
so no blame.  

## 9

Being quiet  
Brim-fill the bowl,  
it'll spill over.  
Keep sharpening the blade,  
you'll soon blunt it.

Nobody can protect  
a house full of gold and jade.  

Wealth, status, pride,  
are their own ruin.  
To do good, work well, and lie low  
is the way of the blessing.  

## 10
Techniques  
Can you keep your soul in its body,  
hold fast to the one,  
and so learn to be whole?  
Can you center your energy,  
be soft, tender,  
and so learn to be a baby?  

Can you keep the deep water still and clear,  
so it reflects without blurring?  
Can you love people and run things,  
and do so by not doing?  

Opening, closing the Gate of Heaven,  
can you be like a bird with her nestlings?  
Piercing bright through the cosmos,  
can you know by not knowing?  

To give birth, to nourish,  
to bear and not to own,  
to act and not lay claim,  
to lead and not to rule:  
this is mysterious power.
